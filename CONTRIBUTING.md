I have to put definition of each category of material here. Soon!

Add link with this format under right section :

```
- [**Site's name or a title**](https://link.domain) : short description

```

* If it has any license or copyright term rather than just *free*, put under **OTHERS** section at the last.
* Add other materials at the end of the list in any section / category.

Thanks!
